# Things to do (Not in any order)

- Implement the algorithm using matrices (currently using arrays)
- Change the code to work with Alexa (I.E getting input from the echo and sending output back to it)
- Improve the storage of data to be more effecient
- Change the storage of data to be presistent. Carry over from each time you use the application.


# Things to Consider
